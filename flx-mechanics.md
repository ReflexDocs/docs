# FLX Mechanics

## 1. Overview

The FLX token has two main functions inside the RAI protocol:

* Backstop mechanism: FLX stakers are the first line of defence in case the RAI protocol goes underwater. The second line of defence is with debt auctions that mint new FLX and auction it in exchange for RAI
* Ungovernance: once governance minimization is finalized, FLX holders will be able to remove control from any remaining components in RAI or, if needed, continue to manage components that may be challenging to ungovern \(such as oracles or any other component interacting with other protocols\)

## 2. RAI Resource Flow

Before the protocol is governance minimized, RAI will be set up so that stability fees flow in three places:

* The stability fee treasury, which is in charge with paying for oracle updates or any other contract meant to automate RAI parameter setting
* FLX stakers, which are the first line of defense for the protocol
* Buyback and burn, which is meant to auction RAI in exchange for FLX which is subsequently burned
