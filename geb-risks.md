# GEB Risks

Using a GEB deployment and/or its associated stable asset doesn't come without risk. Before you decide to deposit your assets in the protocol or acquire the stable asset, you should do your research and understand the risks involved.

This section will only give an overview of the main risks associated with GEB. If you'd like to dive deeper, you can check out every [module](https://docs.reflexer.finance/system-contracts/core) in the System Contracts section.

You can also check our original [whitepaper](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/whitepapers).

### Smart Contract Bugs

The core GEB contracts were audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/open-zeppelin/core-contracts). Other helper contracts were audited by [Quantstamp](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/quantstamp/helper-contracts).

However, security audits do not completely eliminate smart contract risk. We urge you not to put your life savings or money you can't afford to lose into any GEB deployment or its associated stable asset.
