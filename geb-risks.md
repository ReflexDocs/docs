# GEB Risks

Using a GEB deployment and/or its associated stable asset doesn't come without risk. Before you decide to deposit your assets in the protocol or acquire the stable asset, you should do your research and understand the risks involved.

This section will only give an overview of the main risks associated with GEB. If you'd like to dive deeper, you can check out every [module](https://docs.reflexer.finance/system-contracts/core) in the System Contracts section.

You can also check our original [whitepaper](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/whitepapers).

### Smart Contract Bugs

The core GEB contracts were audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/open-zeppelin/core-contracts). Other helper contracts were audited by [Quantstamp](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/quantstamp/helper-contracts).

However, security audits do not completely eliminate smart contract risk. We urge you not to put your life savings or money you can't afford to lose into any GEB deployment or its associated stable asset.

### Admin Keys

The very first GEB deployment will need to be fully governed in its initial stages because of the risks tied to the PID controller managing the system as well as the need for more infrastructure to be built so the protocol can be automated.

Subsequent GEB deployment may or may not be governed, depending on whether the community will want to add more collateral types as time goes by.

You can take a look at the [Governane Minimization Guide](https://docs.reflexer.finance/governance-minimization-guide) to see what will need to be done so that a GEB can be governance minimized. Stay alert for more updates from the Reflexer team regarding a timeline for governance minimization.
