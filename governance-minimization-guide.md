# Governance Minimization Guide

GEB governance minimization is a multi stage process at the end of which governance will not control or be able to upgrade most core contracts and many parameters will be set autonomously by other external contracts.

This guide will go over the requirements needed to governance minimize a GEB, infrastructure needed to automate parameter setting as well as the governance minimization stages that RAI \(and possibly other reflex indexes\) will go through.

###  1. Requirements for Governance Minimization

In order for a GEB to be governance minimized, there are several requirements that need to be met:

* The protocol's governance must not add or plan to add any more collateral types
* All the infrastructure for governance minimization must have been tested for at least 6-10 months prior to minimizing governance
* Governance does not plan to make any more upgrades to the system
* The system must accrue enough surplus in its main treasury so that it affords to pay for oracle, PID and state management costs for at least 6 months
