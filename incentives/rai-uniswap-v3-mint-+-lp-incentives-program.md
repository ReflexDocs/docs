# RAI Uniswap V3 Mint + LP Incentives Program

## Overview

The RAI Mint + LP strategy requires that participants mint RAI **and** provide RAI/ETH liquidity on Uniswap v3 at the same time in order to accrue retroactive rewards.  
  
The RAI/ETH Uniswap v3 pool for this program is [here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x14de8287adc90f0f95bf567c0707670de52e3813). **The program will demo for 2 weeks starting on 9th of July 2021. After the demo, we will gather results and reassess.**

## How It Works

1. Go to [app.reflexer.finance](https://app.reflexer.finance/) or [DeFi Saver](https://app.defisaver.com/reflexer/manage) and mint some RAI.
2. Go to the [RAI/ETH Uniswap v3 pool](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x14de8287adc90f0f95bf567c0707670de52e3813) and add the RAI you minted as liquidity

You do **not** accrue rewards if:

* You provide RAI/ETH liquidity without minting RAI \(e.g buy from the pool and LP\)
* You mint RAI without adding RAI/ETH liquidity

If you mint more RAI than the amount of RAI you provide as liquidity, you only accrue rewards on the amount you minted & LPed. Likewise, if you add more RAI as liquidity than you mint, you accrue rewards only on the RAI amount that you both minted and LPed.
