# Collateral Auction Flash Swaps

## Overview

Normally, the collateral [auction-keeper](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/auction-keeper) uses system coins to bid in fixed discount collateral auctions. A keeper operator must acquire system coins to be prepared for future collateral auctions. With collateral auction flash swaps, this is no longer necessary.

The auction-keeper can be configured to use [Uniswap v2 flash swaps](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/flash-swaps/) when bidding in collateral auctions. This allows the keeper to participate in collateral auctions with no upfront capital other than gas costs to execute the transaction.

## Details

The collateral auction-keeper performs flash swaps using the [geb-keeper-flash-proxy](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-keeper-flash-proxy) contracts.

The flash proxy is used by the auction-keeper to:

1\) Liquidate an underwater SAFE, start a new collateral auction and bid by calling `liquidateAndSettleSAFE`

or

2\) Bid in existing auctions by calling `settleAuction`

See more details for these functions in the [geb-keeper-flash-proxy source code](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-keeper-flash-proxy/blob/master/src/GebUniswapV2KeeperFlashProxyETH.sol).

## Configuration

Use the `--flash-swaps` flag when starting a collateral auction-keeper.

## Flash Swaps in Action

Below you can find the log output from an auction keeper started with the `--flash-swap` flag.

First, the auction keeper finds a critical SAFE and calls `liquidateAndSettleSAFE` in the flash proxy. The keeper then detects two existing auctions and calls `settleAuction` for each one.

## Caveats

* Flash swaps are only supported for collateral auctions
* auction-keeper will not do flash swaps on critical SAFEs with attached saviours. Read more about saviours [here](https://docs.reflexer.finance/integrations/safe-insurance)

## Possible errors

`GebUniswapV2KeeperFlashProxyETH/profit-not-enough-to-repay-the-flashswap`

If this happens, it means that the current system market price is too high in relation to the redemption price and repaying the swap will not yield a profit. Also, the swap itself will move the system market price up. 

This error can occur if there is not enough liquidity in the Uniswap pool to support the swap. In either case, the auction-keeper can be restarted without `--flash-swap` to bid normally using the keeperâ€™s system coin balance.
