# SAFE Management

The recommended way for users to manage SAFEs is through the GebSAFEManager contract, which allows a single address to open multiple SAFEs. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Pyflex does not fully support GebSAFEManager, so only one 'unmanaged' SAFE per address can be managed with pyflex.

Thus, the recommend way to manage SAFEs is through the [app](https://app.reflexer.finance)  or [geb-js](https://docs.reflexer.finance/geb-js/).
{% endhint %}

The follow sections show how to manage SAFEs without the GebSAFEManager, interacting with the SAFEEngine directly.
