# SAFE Management

The recommended way for users to manage SAFEs is through the GebSAFEManager contract, which allows a single address to open multiple SAFEs. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Pyflex does not fully support GebSAFEManager, so only one 'unmanaged' SAFE per address can be opened.

If you need  to open multiple SAFEs per address, use the [app](https://app.reflexer.finance)  or [geb-js](https://docs.reflexer.finance/geb-js/).
{% endhint %}

The follow sections, show how to manage SAFEs without the GebSAFEManager.  These sections interact with the SAFEEngine directly.
