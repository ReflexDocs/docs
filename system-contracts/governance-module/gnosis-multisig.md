# Gnosis Multisig

## 1. Summary <a id="1-introduction-summary"></a>

You can find comprehensive documentation as well as the full source code for the Gnosis Multisig [here](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet).

In [our own version](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-basic-multisig/blob/master/src/MultisigWallet.sol), contract owners can specify `metadata` for each transaction \(details about what the transaction does\). We're also using [Solidity 0.6.7](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.7/) to compile the contract.
