# Intro to The League

### 1. Overview <a href="#1.-overview" id="1.-overview"></a>

The Money God League is an initiative meant to bring non-pegged stable assets (stablecoins) into the mainstream. The League is also devoted toward making control theory a common framework used in a wide variety of DeFi related projects.

### 2. Who Can Be in The League? <a href="#2.-who-can-be-in-the-league" id="2.-who-can-be-in-the-league"></a>

Initially, the Reflexer team will seek to work with a few established projects that have a clear idea of what they want to achieve with their stable assets and also have a roadmap with collateral assets that they want to add in the new protocols.

For now, you can simply join [Reflexer's Discord](https://discord.gg/QYBEw6Z) and start to talk with the core team about building a new Money God. More details will be released in the next few months.
