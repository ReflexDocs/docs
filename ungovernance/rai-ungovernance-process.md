# RAI's Ungovernance Process

## 1. Steps to Deploy Automation Infrastructure

There are three steps that a new smart contract which automates GEB should go through:

* Adding the contract into a bug bounty program
* Deploying and testing the contract on a testnet for several weeks
* Deploying the contract on mainnet

## 2. Current Infrastructure Being Tested
